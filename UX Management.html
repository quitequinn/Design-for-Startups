Typical UX management activities are to define an organization’s UX design language and strategy and manage the work processes around UX design.

UX management comprises two dimensions – strategic and tactical. You can be adept at both, at different times.

   Strategic – You focus on long-term plans: (e.g.) funding models and UX evangelism (where you promote UX in all dimensions, including aligning UX strategy with organizational goals, to identify your team as a corporate asset). You may also become involved in UX process development, project selection, etc. This is higher-level UX management.

   Tactical – Aside from having solid coaching skills and addressing everyday issues, you’re a front-line leader who works directly with UX designers. However many projects your organization handles, you’ll always have one more – you need to manage your team as a collective supply of effort. UX design covers the areas of UI design, usability testing, human factors engineering, among others. Therefore, your skillset should reflect these areas. While it’s unlikely you’ll have all the intimate knowledge your various team members possess, you should still know enough to be able to direct them. Additional areas of focus are that you manage:
      Up – Secure your leaders’ help to get resources/support for the team.
      Across – Liaise with project managers and others as needs be.
      Down – Take on administrative responsibility in regard to Human Resources concerns, training, performance assessment, geographic concerns of having an international team etc.
      
Besides defining experience strategies and how to deliver these, UX managers are likely to work closely with development and product managers in pursuing strategies. What’s more, they’ll likely need to master tools such as Agile and Lean.</script></section></div>
