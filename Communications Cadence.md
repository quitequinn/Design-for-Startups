# Communication and Cadence

The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.

User experience (UX) management is the practice of managing user experience design-related activities inside an organization to create growth and good management practices. Typical UX management activities are to define an organization’s UX design language and strategy and manage the work processes around UX design.

UX management comprises two dimensions – strategic and tactical. You can be adept at both, at different times.

   Strategic – You focus on long-term plans: (e.g.) funding models and UX evangelism (where you promote UX in all dimensions, including aligning UX strategy with organizational goals, to identify your team as a corporate asset). You may also become involved in UX process development, project selection, etc. This is higher-level UX management.

   Tactical – Aside from having solid coaching skills and addressing everyday issues, you’re a front-line leader who works directly with UX designers. However many projects your organization handles, you’ll always have one more – you need to manage your team as a collective supply of effort. UX design covers the areas of UI design, usability testing, human factors engineering, among others. Therefore, your skillset should reflect these areas. While it’s unlikely you’ll have all the intimate knowledge your various team members possess, you should still know enough to be able to direct them. Additional areas of focus are that you manage:
      Up – Secure your leaders’ help to get resources/support for the team.
      Across – Liaise with project managers and others as needs be.
      Down – Take on administrative responsibility in regard to Human Resources concerns, training, performance assessment, geographic concerns of having an international team etc.
      
Besides defining experience strategies and how to deliver these, UX managers are likely to work closely with development and product managers in pursuing strategies. What’s more, they’ll likely need to master tools such as Agile and Lean.

# Project Communication Plan

Communication is an exchange where two parties use symbols, body language or words to convey a message between a sender and a recipient. Who this recipient is or what mechanisms to use to ensure that the message is clearly understood are the kind of elements that one can find in a Communication Management Plan. Effective communication is planned communication! 

A Communication Management Plan is a key document that identifies the communication requirements of the project’s stakeholders and defines and plans how communication about and on the project, should occur to meet these requirements. This project management communication plan template is developed by the Project Manager during the Planning phase of the project and can be an entity on its own or be part of the wider Project Management Plan. It can adopt different formats but is usually created as a document or a spreadsheet and, as any other management documents, it should be validated by key stakeholders, such as the Sponsor.

* Sets the right expectations – everyone knows what is expected of them. 
* Ensures consistency in the message – everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet. 
* Just the right communication – everyone receives just the information they need rather than information overload or no information at all. 
* Enables feedback – everyone has an opportunity to have their voice heard. 
* Gains buy-in – everyone who is kept in the loop is less likely to be a critic of the project.
