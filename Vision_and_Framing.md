### Assumptions
A high-level declaration of what we believe to be true.
This reveals the team’s divergence of opinions and also exposes a broad set of possible solutions.

Problem Statement

Declaring Assumptions

---

#### Problem Statement
The problem statement gives your team a clear focus for their work. It also defines any important constraints.

---

##### Made of three elements:
* The current goals of the product or system
* The problem the business stakeholder wants addressed (i.e., where the goals aren’t being met)
* An explicit request for improvement that doesn’t dictate a specific solution

---

**[Our service/product]** was designed to achieve **[these goals]**. We have observed that the product/service isn’t meeting **[these goals]**, which is causing **[this adverse effect]** to our business. How might we improve **[service/product]** so that our customers are more successful based on **[these measurable criteria]**?

---

#### Declaring Assumptions
Gather your team, and begin declaring assumptions. Make sure you have representatives for each section. It can be helpful to have a framework when organizing your findings.

---

---

##### Please prepare:
* Reports that show how the current product is being used
* Reports that show why customers are taking certain actions
* Info on attempts to fix this issue and their successes/failures
* Analysis of how solving this problem will affect the performance
* Competitive analyses that show how others are tackling this issues

---

### Hypotheses
More granular descriptions of our assumptions that target specific areas of our product or workflow for experimentation.

Hypothesis Statement

Subhypotheses

---

#### Hypothesis Statement
This stage takes much of the subjective and political conversation out of the decision-making process and instead orients the team toward feedback from the market.

---

We believe **[this statement is true]**.

We will know we’re **[right/wrong]** when we see the following feedback from the market:

**[qualitative feedback]** and/or **[quantitative feedback]** and/or **[key performance indicator change]**.

---

#### Subhypotheses
Often your hypothesis is too large to reliably test. Thats why we break them down into Subhypotheses.

---

We believe that **[doing this/building this feature/creating this experience]** for **[these people/personas]** will achieve **[this outcome]**.

We will know this is true when we see **[this market feedback, quantitative measure, or qualitative insight]**.

---

### Outcomes
The signal we seek from the market to help us validate or invalidate our hypotheses. These are often quantitative but can also be qualitative.

---

Look at the high-level outcomes you are trying to improve (e.g., increasing signups, increasing usage, etc.). This will be the indicators of the products performance.

---

### Personas
Models of the people for whom we believe we are solving a problem.

---

1. Sketch/name
1. Behavior/demographic info
1. Pains & Gains
1. Requested solutions

---

Lean UX Personas start with validated assumptions. Instead of spending months interviewing people, we spend a few hours creating proto-personas. This helps us avoid the Sunk cost fallacy. 

Its ok to improve proto-personas as we learn more.

---

### Features
The product changes or improvements we believe will drive the outcomes we seek.

---

The important difference in Lean UX is that features exist to serve the needs of the business, the customer, and the user. Feature Lists and Gant charts are helpful, but try to prioritize features where your time provides the most satisfaction.
